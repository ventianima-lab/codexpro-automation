## Unreleased - Add an unknown-run lock quarantine escape hatch

- Same-task operators can now quarantine any stopped unresolved Oracle run
  after ordinary recovery is exhausted. The provider outcome remains unknown,
  the unchanged run is atomically archived with crash-resumable append-only
  receipts, and the active local lock is released.
- Fresh prompts remain blocked by the quarantine receipt until a separate,
  exact-hash user authorization acknowledges possible duplicate execution.
  Foreign-task ownership and live run-owned processes remain fail-closed.

## 1.20.15 - Verify the current GPT-5.6 Sol Pro power slider

- Oracle 0.18.0 now recognizes ChatGPT's current unified `Thinking effort`
  picker, where Pro is represented by the simple Power slider as `Pro, 5 of
  5` instead of a separate Heavy/Pro effort row. An already-selected Pro tier
  is accepted only when the same visible menu also proves that the checked
  model is exactly `GPT-5.6 Sol`.
- When the slider is below Pro, the adapter uses bounded ArrowRight input and
  requires two consecutive post-change proofs of both Power 5/5 and the exact
  checked model. A missing slider, changed model, unavailable control, or
  unverified result remains a pre-submit failure; no lower effort is submitted
  as Pro.
- The compatibility patch is hash-gated against the exact published Oracle
  0.18.0 package, and the regression fixture preserves the live 2026-09-02 UI
  shape whose trigger is named `Thinking effort` rather than `Pro`.
- The live slider's accessibility range is zero-based (`0..4`) even though its
  visible position is one-based (`5 of 5`). The verifier now derives the
  ordinal from `aria-valuemin`, `aria-valuemax`, and `aria-valuenow`, then
  requires it to match the visible `N of M` position before accepting Pro.
- Model rows that mount after the controlled slider fragment are observed with
  a bounded two-sample stability check. Conflicting ranges, wrong models, and
  duplicate explicit picker menus remain fail-closed, and the immediately
  preceding exact patch can be migrated through its hash-bound legacy patch.

## 1.20.14 - Select the current visible Pro effort fail-closed

- New GPT-5.6 Sol Pro and read-only Pro follow-up submissions now pass Oracle
  0.18.0's explicit `pro` thinking-time token instead of the retired `heavy`
  compatibility spelling. A missing effort on a new Pro manifest normalizes to
  `pro`, while regular non-Pro defaults remain unchanged.
- Historical `heavy` runs, immutable receipts, no-submission evidence, and
  follow-up parents remain readable and recoverable without rewriting their
  authority. Only new child submissions are normalized to `pro`; a newly
  supplied raw Pro manifest that still requests `heavy` is rejected before a
  run directory or subprocess can be created.
- If the current ChatGPT effort selector cannot prove that the visible `Pro`
  radio is selected, the run fails before submission as
  `ORACLE_PRO_TIER_NOT_SELECTED`; it may not silently continue on Extra High.
  Regression coverage binds the current five-label effort menu and preserves
  the bounded legacy Oracle 0.17.1 compatibility paths.

## 1.20.13 - Preserve exact task-bound metadata settlements

- A `v1.20.12` Oracle metadata-rename settlement created immediately before
  the final task-binding hardening remains valid when its append-only artifact
  lacks only the later `host_failure.source_thread_id` field. Revalidation
  still requires the current state, originating task, ownership block, and
  immutable ownership receipt to bind the same valid Codex task UUID, and
  every pre-existing host-failure field and hash must match exactly.
- Legacy-unbound runs, foreign-task settlement attempts, changed ownership
  receipt hashes, provider output/conversation evidence, and any other field
  drift remain fail-closed. This prevents an already settled pre-submit run
  from resurrecting its task-scoped project lock after upgrading.

## 1.20.12 - Retry transient Windows Oracle metadata replacement

- Oracle 0.18.0 session metadata now retries only transient Windows `EPERM`,
  `EACCES`, and `EBUSY` failures while atomically replacing `meta.json`. This
  prevents a pre-submit run from dying when antivirus or another short-lived
  reader briefly holds the destination, while preserving fail-closed behavior
  for every other platform and error.
- If the bounded retry still exhausts before any browser runtime or conversation
  exists, the exact task owner may use the normal explicit
  `settle-no-submission` path. The evidence binds the exact Oracle locator,
  immutable mission and ownership receipt, pending session metadata, exited
  controller, empty output/conversation/browser identity, and the exact Windows
  atomic-rename error; path, runtime, URL, output, or receipt contradictions
  remain ineligible. The state, ownership block, and append-only receipt must
  all bind the same valid Codex task UUID; legacy-unbound and foreign-task
  settlement attempts remain forbidden.

## 1.20.11 - Recover exact ordinary DevSpace prompt timeouts

- task-bound 일반 `devspace` 실행이 prompt commit timeout 뒤 browser identity
  receipt를 만들기 전에 끝나도, 동일한 Oracle zero-turn commit probe와
  profile-bound browser 메타가 정확히 일치할 때에만 `harvest --dry-run`을
  허용합니다. live recovery는 계속 receipt 없이 거부되고, harvest 뒤에도
  hash-bound recovery evidence와 명시적 사용자 no-submission 확인이 있어야만
  정산·잠금 해제가 가능합니다.
- exact harvest는 zero-turn/ownership/mission/profile/browser-config 증거를
  append-only 영수증으로 봉인합니다. 정산과 이후 잠금 판정은 그 영수증의
  SHA-256과 현재 불변 증거를 다시 대조하므로, generic recovery 로그만으로
  정산 권한을 얻을 수 없습니다.
- 모델 ID `gpt-5.6`은 실제 Oracle browser 메타의 선택 라벨 `GPT-5.6 Sol`에
  정확히 결속합니다. 다른 모델·전략·thinking time 또는 zero-turn 증거의
  모순은 계속 fail-closed 합니다.

## 1.20.10 - Persist Oracle Local network access and expose audit receipts

- Oracle 0.18.0이 띄우는 격리 Chrome에만 `--disable-session-crashed-bubble`을
  해시 결속 패치로 추가하고, Oracle seed 프로필의 `exit_type=Normal` 및
  `exited_cleanly=true`를 백업·SHA 영수증과 함께 고정합니다. 일반 Chrome의
  세션 복원 설정과 열린 탭은 변경하지 않습니다.
- 사용자 범위 Chrome 정책 ACL이 쓰기 금지인 Windows에서도 `enable`이 실패 안내로
  끝나지 않고, 닫힌 Oracle seed 프로필의 정확한 `chatgpt.com` origin에 Chrome 151+
  `local_network`와 `loopback_network` 허용을 백업·원자적 쓰기·SHA 영수증과 함께
  저장합니다. 일반 Chrome 프로필, 로그인, 쿠키, 다른 사이트 권한은 변경하지 않습니다.
- `status`는 enterprise policy와 Oracle seed 프로필을 함께 검증하므로 throwaway 실행이
  복제 전에 실제 영속 권한을 갖는지 판정합니다.
- DevSpace 1.0.8의 `open_workspace`, `read`, `read_chunk`가 서버 생성 Audit receipt ID를
  텍스트뿐 아니라 각 도구의 `structuredContent`와 output schema에도 노출해, ChatGPT 앱
  렌더러가 보조 text block을 생략하더라도 final canary challenge-response를 완결합니다.
- Oracle 실행 종료 뒤 Windows가 PID를 재사용하더라도 PID 존재만으로 과거 실행을
  살아 있다고 오판하지 않습니다. 현재 프로세스의 exact slug·run 디렉터리·격리
  브라우저 프로필 결속을 확인하며, 읽을 수 없거나 모호한 신원은 계속 fail-closed 합니다.

## 1.20.9 - Preserve registered apps across DevSpace updates

- 기존 ChatGPT 개발 앱의 이름·MCP URL·OAuth 연결을 업그레이드가 보존하고,
  도구 목록이 오래된 경우에는 앱 재생성 대신 기존 앱의 `새로 고침` 후 필요한
  경우에만 `다시 연결`하도록 한영 온보딩과 진단 메시지를 바로잡았습니다.
- DevSpace 1.0.8의 `ui://devspace/workspace-app.html` 리소스에 공개 HTTPS origin을
  hash-gated `ui.domain`으로 결속해 앱 제출 화면의 widget-domain 누락 경고를
  제거합니다. HTTP, 자격 증명이 포함된 URL, loopback origin은 fail-closed 됩니다.
- 관리형 DevSpace 복구가 healthy 401만 보고 패치 적용을 건너뛰지 않고 매번 exact
  package/native/compatibility 상태를 재검증합니다. 실제 restart marker가 있을 때만
  서비스를 한 번 재기동하며 malformed marker 보고는 재시작 없이 거부합니다.
- OAuth replay canary timeout을 구조화된 비밀 없는 오류로 남기고, Chrome의 분리된
  Local Network/loopback 정책과 기존 온보딩 상태 마이그레이션을 회귀 테스트합니다.

## 1.20.8 - Decode Tailscale status as UTF-8 during onboarding

- Windows 한국어 로케일에서도 `onboard.py start`가 `tailscale status --json`의
  비 ASCII 장치 정보를 CP949로 오해하지 않도록 stdout bytes를 UTF-8 strict로
  직접 디코딩합니다.
- 잘못된 인코딩은 기존 `TAILSCALE_HOSTNAME_UNAVAILABLE` fail-closed 오류로 유지하고,
  실제 UTF-8 비 ASCII 상태 응답과 손상된 응답을 모두 회귀 테스트합니다.

## 1.20.7 - Bind registered-app final gates to server receipts

- 새 일반 비-Pro final canary만 `registered_app_final_gate`로 명시해 실제 생성된
  Oracle `run_id`를 `open_workspace → read → read_chunk`의 동일 `auditNonce`로
  결속합니다. 세 호출은 재시도 없이 정확히 한 번씩 수행되고 세 서버 생성 영수증 ID를
  답변에 echo해야 합니다.
- `onboard.py prepare-final-gate`가 current Codex task에 결속된 exact manifest와
  dry-run/live/record 명령을 생성합니다. 다른 작업, 일반 터미널, Pro, 비정규 모델/노력은
  제출 전에 fail-closed 됩니다.
- 기존 ordinary/Pro/legacy prompt와 v1.20.6 이전 final-gate 기록은 그대로 호환됩니다.

## 1.20.6 - Explain frozen registered-app Action snapshots

- 최종 canary에서 `open_workspace`와 `read`는 성공하지만 `read_chunk` 또는
  서버 생성 Audit receipt ID가 없을 때, 로컬 DevSpace 장애로 오인하지 않고
  ChatGPT의 등록 앱 Action 스냅샷 갱신이 필요한 상태로 명확히 분류합니다.
- Enterprise/Edu의 `Action control > Refresh`와 Business/미지원 UI의 앱 재생성·게시,
  수동 Action 검토, `post-register` 1회, 새 일반 비-Pro auditNonce canary 순서를
  한영 설치 마법사와 문서에 안내합니다.
- 세 도구와 세 서버 영수증의 fail-closed 최종 gate는 완화하지 않습니다.

## 1.20.5 - Harden managed DevSpace cold-start confirmation

- Windows의 첫 `npx` DevSpace 1.0.8 기동이 20초를 넘는 경우에도 관리형
  재시작 증명이 조기 실패하지 않도록, 정확한 post-patch listener 신원 확인의
  bounded 대기를 120초로 늘렸습니다.
- 단순 포트나 `/healthz` 응답으로 완화하지 않고, 기존의 패치 해시, 정확한
  `dist/cli.js serve` 명령, 패치 이후 시작 시각 검증을 모두 유지합니다.
- 60초 지연 listener와 old/foreign listener를 함께 재현하는 회귀 테스트를
  추가해 marker가 정확한 새 서비스에서만 제거되는 것을 검증합니다.

## 1.20.4 - Validate DevSpace 1.0.8

- DevSpace `1.0.8` is the explicit current runtime for new setup and managed
  macOS launches after archive-integrity, exact patch, and compatibility-gate
  validation. DevSpace `1.0.7` is retained as the rollback LKG; neither path
  resolves a moving npm `latest` tag.
- The release portability workflow prepares only the hash-verified published
  `1.0.8` archive before running the cross-platform contract suite.
- DevSpace `1.0.8` adds an optional local-agent daemon and provider CLI
  adapters. Managed ChatGPT workspace services pin `DEVSPACE_SUBAGENTS=false`;
  enabling that separate execution surface remains an explicit user action.
- The fast pre-submit gate now runs a named cross-section of runner launch,
  ownership, app-read, completion, restart, and recovery contracts while the
  full suite retains every exhaustive contradiction permutation. This restores
  the 100-second CI budget without reducing full release coverage.

## 1.20.3 - Preserve follow-up evidence before browser launch

- A live read-only Pro `followup` now creates the exact child run directory,
  state, stdout, and stderr before the app-read, DevSpace-root, runtime-version,
  and compatibility preflights. A bounded failure therefore produces a normal
  pre-submit child and round-result receipt instead of leaving only a consumed
  parent reservation.
- Every non-dry-run follow-up appends a parent-side launch receipt before
  entering the child runner. An exception that occurs even before the child
  layout exists appends a hash-bound prelaunch-failure receipt with the exact
  error and `submission_action: none`.
- Follow-up manifests are parsed from the same verified byte buffer whose
  SHA-256 is sealed in the launch receipt and are checked again immediately
  before `Popen`. The reservation mission SHA-256 is enforced both before
  child preparation and immediately before submission. A parent-scoped
  controller mutex serializes every round key through execution, and symlinked
  parent artifact directories or manifest leaves fail closed.
- An unknown exception without child state is recorded as
  `submitted_unknown`; only the bounded pre-layout manifest/mission/path
  failures may claim `submission_action: none`.
- `--dry-run` remains side-effect free. Historical reservation-only round keys
  are immutable and stay consumed; operators must preserve them and, only
  after proving the detached controller ended, choose a new round key rather
  than deleting or replaying the old reservation.

## 1.20.2 - Prove exact app reads and close onboarding gaps

- New read-only Pro runs are blocked before browser creation unless a recent
  regular non-Pro final gate proves `open_workspace`, `read`, and `read_chunk`
  for the exact requested root through the configured app. A receipt for a
  different allowed root cannot authorize the run.
- Oracle state can now append the Pro app-read gate and provider-session
  evidence without inventing a status transition. Only exact-bound upstream
  `completed` metadata confirms provider terminal state; a local/browser
  `error` with `completedAt` remains nonterminal evidence.
- The Oracle `0.17.1` LKG and current `0.18.0` compatibility contracts now warn
  when a previously detected thinking label disappears for five minutes, while
  keeping the independent terminal watchdog active. Exact legacy-patch
  migration and behavior tests cover both the original never-detected case and
  the detected-then-missing case.
- Onboarding now labels Oracle login and ChatGPT app registration as user
  attestations until the functional final read gate succeeds. The Korean and
  English quick paths list the same nine-stage order and explain that a pasted
  repository URL is checked out by the coding agent before the local wizard
  starts. Its initial status says setup is in progress instead of claiming the
  program install is already complete before the install receipt exists.
- Ultra Economy activation no longer implies Pro authority. Its mandatory
  read-only Pro design stage requires a separate explicit user authorization
  plus `allow_pro: true`; otherwise the profile fails closed before submission.
- GitHub workflows pin checkout and Python setup actions to exact commits, and
  the drift watcher refuses an unmanaged or duplicate exact-title issue instead
  of creating a second `Upstream runtime drift` issue. Release publication now
  also requires a final-head independent-review receipt on the merged validation
  PR plus successful three-OS portability CI for the exact main commit.
- Atomic Oracle state writes use a short same-directory temporary basename so
  deep but valid Windows settlement paths do not cross `MAX_PATH` before the
  final atomic replace. The current and legacy thinking-status patch files are
  both included in lifecycle installs.

## 1.20.1 - Assign and gate upstream runtime promotion

- The six-hour watcher remains strictly read-only, but its stable drift issue
  now carries the scheduled Codex maintainer promotion/validation owner, 24-hour validation-start and
  48-hour all-gates promotion targets, exact candidate integrity, a dedicated
  label, and the complete machine-readable gate checklist. A routine stable
  patch/minor candidate has standing approval only after every gate passes;
  breaking, permission/OAuth, patch-conflict, failed-canary, and ambiguous
  cases still require explicit user approval.
- Runtime policy schema v2 makes the reporter, promotion owner, test owner,
  approval split, timing, and closed evidence set mandatory instead of relying
  on the vague instruction to promote promptly.
- Reporter permissions and maintainer permissions are now separate fields: the
  reporter cannot mutate runtime state, while the scheduled maintainer may
  promote, publish, install, and perform one safe-window restart after all
  routine gates pass. This closes the previous policy gap where a candidate
  could be detected without naming who actually deploys it.
- The watcher resolves only one exact-title drift issue and fails closed on
  duplicates; it creates a missing label without overwriting existing label
  metadata.
- DevSpace promotion and post-repair verification now require a separate
  mission-file `read` and `read_chunk` through the exact workspace ID returned
  by `open_workspace`. The gate verifies the server-returned complete SHA-256
  against the locally bound mission bytes, so matching self-authored workspace
  ID markers cannot pass. HTTP 401 health, workspace-open success, or bundled
  instructions alone cannot hide an intermittent `mcp_network_error` read path,
  and Pro stays blocked until a fresh regular non-Pro canary succeeds.
- The audit nonce now makes `open_workspace` the first workspace/process/
  mutation call in the opaque OpenAI session scope, disables every workspace
  mutation surface including `download_artifact`, and server-numbers the exact
  three receipt steps. Each tool response returns an unpredictable server receipt
  ID; the exact terminal Oracle conversation must echo all three IDs, binding the
  opaque DevSpace scope to that public conversation. The final gate rejects
  duplicate-key JSON, mixed workspaces/scopes, partial/tail chunks, missing
  challenge responses, and a receipt digest that does not match the exact mission.
- The host maintainer heartbeat is now represented by a checked-in exact contract
  and a verifier that compares the active Codex automation TOML. Downstream
  installs receive the audit contract but never auto-register the maintainer task.
- Read-only diagnosis now gives the bounded signature
  `registered-app-read-network-failure-after-workspace-open` when durable
  terminal evidence proves that workspace open succeeded but a same-connector
  file read failed with `mcp_network_error: Connection failed`.

## 1.20.0 - Follow validated upstream stable runtimes

- Oracle `0.18.0` and DevSpace `1.0.7` are now the defaults for new work after
  published-integrity, exact-patch, syntax, compatibility, and cross-platform
  validation. Oracle `0.17.1` and DevSpace `1.0.4` remain rollback LKG and exact
  historical-recovery contracts rather than continuing as stale defaults.
- A strict machine-readable runtime registry and six-hour read-only GitHub
  drift watcher compare current versions with official npm `latest`. The
  watcher maintains one issue and cannot promote, install, restart services,
  open ChatGPT, or modify a project.
- Current Oracle keeps task-scoped ownership, no-duplicate/prompt-not-observed
  fail-closed behavior, dynamic CDP binding, saved-output recovery, and bounded
  terminal-marker detection while inheriting upstream UI/model/cookie fixes.
- Current DevSpace keeps the existing allowed-root, OAuth replay, write/delete,
  large-read, and workspace-context safety canaries while inheriting upstream
  restart-safe conversation/workspace reuse and actionable workspace errors.
- The first-install and update wizard can now stop an exact running DevSpace
  `1.0.4` LKG service while upgrading to `1.0.7`. The stop authority remains
  limited to the resolved current/LKG `dist/cli.js serve` identity; arbitrary
  package versions and unrelated listeners still fail closed.

## 1.19.7 - settle direct DevSpace model-option misses safely

- Ordinary `devspace` runs that fail before submission because Oracle 0.17.1
  cannot find the requested model option can now enter the existing explicit
  user-confirmed no-submission settlement path instead of retaining a permanent
  task-scoped project lock.
- Admission binds the exact 13-line Oracle launcher/error transcript, requested
  model and browser profile, mission hashes, prompt-free no-tab/no-URL recovery,
  and strict duplicate-free Oracle metadata proving `execute-browser`,
  `promptSubmitted=false`, and the ChatGPT root URL. A conversation, output,
  changed model/profile/research settings, metadata drift, symlink, duplicate
  key, or foreign transport remains fail-closed.
- The change integrates the narrow intent of PR #20 onto the current Oracle
  ownership, follow-up, terminal-watchdog, and saved-output identity code rather
  than replacing those newer lifecycle guarantees with its older base.
- Live and durable terminal classifiers now accept up to 32 bounded provider
  reference-backlink rows that begin with an exact file-like citation and may
  include rendered section labels, quoted annotations, or semicolon-separated
  paths before the final `↩`. Ordinary prose, duplicate markers, oversized
  footers, and rows without a file-like citation remain fail-closed.

## 1.19.6 - preserve follow-up authority after saved-output reconciliation

- A saved-output reconciliation can now seal a separate v2 browser identity
  receipt when the runner's reserved CDP port differs from Oracle's completed
  runtime port. The original expected port remains bound to the ownership and
  follow-up receipts; the observed port is recorded separately and never
  rewrites historical authority.
- The owner-only `seal-saved-output-browser-identity` command migrates an
  already reconciled v1.19.5 run without opening Chrome, attaching CDP, sending
  a prompt, or changing the conversation. New mismatched-port reconciliations
  seal the same receipt automatically, and interrupted sealing remains safely
  repeatable.
- Follow-up admission revalidates the saved-output settlement, output, stdout,
  transcript, completed Oracle metadata, conversation, target, run-local
  profile, immutable ownership/follow-up receipts, and stopped run-owned PIDs.
  Foreign tasks, symlinks, drift, active processes, matching-port widening, and
  conflicting receipts continue to fail closed.
- Portable test processes now use a PID outside normal Windows/Linux ranges so
  Ubuntu CI cannot mistake an unrelated live runner process for a fixture's
  Oracle child.

## 1.19.5 - reconcile Oracle-saved terminal output

- Added an owner-only `settle-saved-output` lifecycle command for the narrow
  crash boundary where Oracle has already saved official terminal output and
  strict completed session metadata, but the outer runner did not commit the
  final state transition. It never sends, recovers, retries, or edits a foreign
  task's run.
- Reconciliation is hash-bound to the prior state, official output, stdout,
  Oracle metadata, immutable ownership receipt, and exact follow-up binding.
  It also requires one canonical saved-output log record, the unchanged parent
  conversation and isolated profile, a valid terminal outcome/Pro schema,
  empty stderr, and stopped observer/controller/Chrome processes.
- The command writes an append-only receipt before marking the exact run
  `complete / terminal / terminal_harvested`. Existing browser-receipt recovery
  remains unchanged; path drift, symlinks, live PIDs, foreign ownership,
  conversation mismatch, and ambiguous output continue to fail closed.

## 1.19.4 - bound follow-up browser and terminal detection

- Oracle follow-up runs now keep the child's newly reserved CDP port instead
  of silently inheriting the parent conversation's old port. The exact child
  state, ownership receipt, Chrome runtime, and durable browser identity remain
  bound to one port; a mismatch is recorded as a non-authoritative diagnostic
  and never accepted as recovery authority.
- The v1 terminal watchdog now accepts exactly one `TASK_OUTCOME` marker when
  ChatGPT renders only a bounded set of reference backlinks after it. Ordinary
  trailing prose, malformed footers, more than 32 backlinks, duplicate or
  conflicting markers, visible Stop controls, and active thinking still fail
  closed. The durable result classifier uses the same bounded grammar, so a
  watchdog-terminal answer cannot later regress to an unknown task outcome.
- Each run persists whether the runner actually enabled the child-only v1
  terminal-watchdog environment. An exact v1 run fails before Oracle launch if
  that environment contract cannot be enabled; no user- or machine-global
  environment variable is required.

## 1.19.3 - task-targeted operational reports

- Oracle incident packets now record the exact run owner, the task from which
  the evidence was evaluated, and a run/slug-bound operational instruction.
  Unresolved-owner checks use the run owner's task scope instead of an
  unqualified project-wide view.
- A foreign evaluator receives only `route-to-owner-task`; it never receives
  executable recover, harvest, settle, stop, or retry authority. Reports must
  be rendered separately for each target task instead of broadcasting an
  owner's next action to sibling tasks sharing the same project root.
- Exact runs already proven terminal and harvested emit `action=none`, even
  when the local status remains `attention_required`. Incident v1 packets stay
  validation-compatible, while new packets use the closed v2 routing fields.

## 1.19.2 - action-bar-independent Oracle completion

- Oracle 0.17.1 can now finish an exact v1 task-outcome run when ChatGPT omits
  the transient thinking/streaming label and completion action bar. The bounded
  fallback requires the same conversation and new assistant turn already
  enforced by Oracle, no Stop control, no active strong-thinking signal, an
  unchanged full response across two observations for at least five seconds,
  and exactly one final `TASK_OUTCOME` marker.
- The fallback is enabled only for the runner's explicit v1 answer contract.
  Legacy and generic Oracle runs scrub any inherited opt-in variable and retain
  upstream behavior. Live/harvest recovery inherits the persisted contract
  without creating a new prompt or conversation.
- A distinct warning is emitted after five minutes when no thinking status has
  ever been detected, while the independent terminal watchdog continues. This
  distinguishes a missing UI label from ordinary visible streaming without
  treating elapsed time as terminal.

## 1.19.1 - structured follow-up pre-composer settlement

- Follow-up failures are no longer eligible for no-submission settlement only
  because an error sentence appears in a growing text whitelist. An exact
  task/run/mission/round binding can now use Oracle's structured
  `resume-conversation` error, absent browser runtime and identity receipt,
  matching stdout/transcript, empty stderr, absent output, and exited observer
  as bounded pre-composer evidence. Explicit owner confirmation and inactive
  exact processes remain mandatory before releasing the task-scoped lock;
  stale `process-exited` state is rejected while the recorded PID is alive or
  its termination cannot be proven.
- Resumed-conversation hydration receives one bounded second observation window
  on the same exact conversation. The retry verifies the conversation identity
  before waiting again and never falls back to a fresh chat or submits a prompt
  while prior turns remain unsettled.
- Portable Windows doctor checks now accept the active `python.exe` runtime
  when the POSIX-style `python3` command name is unavailable.

## 1.19.0 - unify Ultra GPT and closed workflow auditing

- `strict-ultra` is no longer presented as a separate mode. New workflows use
  `workflow_profile: ultra-gpt` and add an explicit `closed_audit` contract
  only when machine-verifiable provenance is required.
- The optional audit reuses the existing Ultra GPT scheduler and adds the
  bound dependency, authority, advisory Research Governor, identity ledger,
  local-gate receipt, and final workflow audit without changing ordinary Ultra
  GPT behavior.
- Legacy `workflow_profile: strict-ultra` manifests, frozen
  `codex.chatgpt.strict-ultra-*/v1` artifacts, receipts, and recovery identities
  remain accepted without rewriting. Dry-run reports the old profile name as a
  deprecated compatibility alias.
- README, English README, repository/global policy, Ultra GPT skill, and docs
  now expose one Ultra GPT mode with an optional closed-audit capability.

## 1.18.6 - follow-up no-submission settlement continuity

- An archived-parent follow-up that failed before the composer now goes
  directly to explicit user-confirmed no-submission settlement. Recovery and
  harvest are rejected with
  `FOLLOWUP_ARCHIVED_PARENT_HARVEST_NOT_APPLICABLE`, because reopening the
  already-known parent cannot prove a child submission.
- A v1.18.5 run that already followed the earlier harvest guidance remains
  settleable only when the exact owned slug produced one strict no-live-tab /
  no-recoverable-URL log pair, no recovery state, no child conversation URL,
  no output, no nonempty candidate, and no additional recovery artifacts.
  Partial, linked, changed, symlinked, or ambiguous evidence still fails closed.
- Historical official follow-up settlement receipts created under the v1
  eligibility label are revalidated against today's stricter raw-artifact
  predicate without rewriting the receipt. Compatibility is limited to the
  original textarea-absent evidence class; all hashes, task/run/mission/parent,
  round, recovery, and Oracle metadata bindings must remain exact.

## 1.18.5 - durable read-only Pro follow-up parents

- New `pro-devspace-readonly` manifests normalize the default `archive=auto`
  to `archive=never`, so a successful parent remains available for the next
  task-bound round. Explicit `archive=always` remains a deliberate single-turn
  choice, and historical archived parents keep bounded compatibility restore.
- Oracle 0.17.1 archived-parent restore now recognizes the direct page restore
  control as well as menu/dialog controls, uses pointer-compatible clicks and
  bounded polling, and seals a structured before-composer failure receipt with
  exact parent URL and unchanged turn counts.
- The exact `unarchive-menu-not-found` child from v1.18.4 can enter the official
  user-confirmed no-submission path without reopening the old parent. The gate
  remains owner/binding/hash bound and additionally requires the latest exact
  v1.18.4 lifecycle receipt to predate the immutable ownership receipt. It
  rejects URL drift or any click/submission ambiguity, requires all exact
  run-owned processes to be stopped, and never releases ownership without
  explicit user confirmation.
- Known v1.18.4 Oracle patch hashes migrate through exact reverse patches, so
  global upgrades remain deterministic even when the pristine npm backup is
  unavailable.

## 1.18.4 - archived Pro follow-up conversation restoration

- A task-bound read-only Pro follow-up now detects the exact parent's durable
  archive state. If the bound conversation was archived, Oracle 0.17.1 restores
  only that exact `chatgpt.com/c/<id>` conversation before composer readiness
  and re-archives it after the round completes.
- Local and remote browser resume paths fail closed on URL drift, missing or
  ambiguous restore controls, or an unverified final archive state. They never
  create a replacement conversation.
- Follow-up reservations now seal an append-only child binding before browser
  launch, including task, parent, round, mission, exact conversation, and CDP
  identity.
- A pre-composer `Prompt textarea did not appear` child can use one prompt-free
  exact harvest and explicit owner confirmation only after its parent/round
  reservation, error metadata, empty runtime, artifacts, and exact parent URL
  are revalidated. The consumed round key remains non-reusable.

## 1.18.3 - task-bound Pro 프롬프트 미관찰 교착 수리

- `pro-devspace-readonly` 실행이 프롬프트 commit 확인 전에 실패해 conversation
  URL 기반 browser identity receipt를 만들지 못한 경우에도, 같은 Codex task가
  exact slug에 대해 prompt-free `harvest` 한 번을 수행할 수 있게 했습니다.
- 이 예외는 서명된 task/run/mission ownership receipt, GPT-5.6 Sol Pro 읽기 전용
  프로필, Oracle 0.17.1의 `submit-prompt/prompt-commit-timeout`, 0개 turn과 모두
  false인 commit probe, ChatGPT 루트 composer, 출력·대화 URL 부재, exact 동적
  CDP port·격리 profile·target 결속이 모두 맞을 때만 열립니다. `live`, 새 prompt,
  외부 task, 일반 Chrome, 모순된 URL·probe·port·profile·target은 계속 거부됩니다.
- task-bound run의 프로젝트 mission 파일이 실행 뒤 합법적으로 수정돼도, immutable
  run mission 사본과 ownership receipt가 같은 원래 mission hash를 봉인하면 수확과
  사용자 확인 정산을 재검증할 수 있습니다. legacy-unbound run은 기존처럼 현재 source
  bytes 일치를 요구합니다.
- 수확은 소유권을 자동 해제하지 않습니다. exact no-tab/no-URL recovery 증거가 생성된
  뒤에도 사용자의 명시적 `user-confirmed-no-submission` 정산이 있어야만 프로젝트 lock이
  해제됩니다.

## 1.18.2 - 종결 Pro 후속 대화 신원 검증 수정

- Oracle이 실행 종료 과정에서 `meta.json`에 archive와 prompt 상태를 추가해도
  task-bound `pro-devspace-readonly` 부모의 후속 라운드가 잘못
  `FOLLOWUP_PARENT_IDENTITY_INVALID`로 거부되지 않게 했습니다.
- 영수증의 `oracle_meta_sha256`은 캡처 시점 전체 메타데이터의 감사 증거로
  보존하되, 권한 검증은 task/run/mission/slug와 Chrome PID·부모 PID·격리
  profile·동적 CDP port·target·conversation URL의 불변 결속을 사용합니다.
- 종료 후 비신원 메타데이터 변경은 허용하지만, 브라우저 target·profile·port·
  대화 또는 영수증 자체가 달라지면 계속 실패 폐쇄됩니다. 기존 v1.18.1
  append-only browser receipt도 같은 불변 튜플로 호환 검증합니다.
- Windows observer가 동시에 상태를 읽는 짧은 구간에 `state.json` 원자 교체가
  공유 위반(오류 5/32)을 만나는 경우만 제한적으로 재시도합니다. 지속 오류와
  그 밖의 파일 오류는 계속 즉시 실패 폐쇄됩니다.

## 1.18.1 - Pro 읽기 전용 정책 복원

- 모든 신규 `GPT-5.6 Sol / Pro` DevSpace 실행을 읽기 전용 설계·자문·검토
  단계로 제한합니다. Pro는 프로젝트 파일을 생성·수정·삭제하거나 명령을
  실행하지 않습니다.
- 쓰기 또는 명령 실행이 필요한 작업은 별도의 일반 `GPT-5.6` 최고 비-Pro
  사고 단계(`extra-high`)가 exact-root DevSpace에서 수행합니다.
- 이미 저장된 과거 `pro-devspace` 읽기·쓰기 실행은 exact recovery 시 원래
  권한 의미를 보존하며, 새 실행만 `pro-devspace-readonly`로 생성됩니다.
- 명시적 `pro-attachment`는 불변·외부 증거를 위한 별도 읽기 전용 경로로
  유지하며 DevSpace 실패의 자동 fallback으로 사용하지 않습니다.
- Oracle 소유권을 프로젝트 폴더가 아니라 Codex task와 exact run에 결속합니다.
  같은 project root의 서로 다른 task는 별도 mutex, slug, 브라우저 프로필,
  동적 CDP port와 대화를 소유해 동시에 실행할 수 있고, 같은 task의 미해결
  실행만 중복 제출을 막습니다. 다른 task의 실행은 `FOREIGN_TASK_SESSION`으로
  표시하되 recover/harvest/stop하지 않습니다.
- 제출 직후 conversation URL과 Chrome/controller PID, profile, CDP port,
  target identity를 append-only browser receipt에 기록해 프로세스 종료 뒤에도
  어느 task/run의 대화인지 재검증할 수 있게 했습니다.
- task-bound terminal `pro-devspace-readonly` 대화에는 내부 전용 `followup`
  명령으로만 후속 라운드를 보낼 수 있습니다. 각 라운드는 같은 ChatGPT
  conversation을 증명하면서 새 Oracle run/slug와 append-only 예약·결과 영수증에
  mission/state/output/transcript hash를 남깁니다. raw follow-up 옵션, foreign/legacy
  owner, 대화 변경, 중복 round는 계속 실패 폐쇄됩니다.
- 최초 설치 마법사는 기존 DevSpace root를 병합 보존하고 손상 config를 거부하며,
  Local Multi-GPT 선택을 실제 doctor와 결속하고, Chrome Local Network 변경 전
  명시적 동의를 요구합니다. ngrok 임시 주소를 차단하고 provider별 재부팅 안내를
  분리했으며, 설치 질문과 단계 안내를 환경에 따라 한국어/영어로 표시합니다.
- 최종 설치 gate는 임의 설명이 아니라 exact 일반 비-Pro Oracle run, root/app,
  GPT-5.6 extra-high, conversation URL, terminal outcome, output/listing SHA를
  재검증합니다. 한국어와 영어 전체 설치 가이드를 함께 제공합니다.

## 1.18.0 - WebJjonku Oracle 0.18 후속 실행 timeout 호환성

- 일반 comprehensive 자동화는 계속 검증된 Oracle 0.17.1만 허용하고,
  WebJjonku Linux 배포가 명시적으로 `webjjonku-linux` profile을 선택한 경우에만
  Oracle 0.18.0의 후속 실행 timeout 전달 패치를 적용합니다.
- 0.18.0 패치는 pristine·patched SHA-256과 npm integrity를 모두 확인하고,
  명시한 `--browser-timeout`만 child follow-up에 전달합니다. profile 누락,
  알 수 없는 버전, 해시 불일치는 브라우저 실행 전에 실패 폐쇄됩니다.
- 범위 제한 프로필은 버전·설치 루트·archive를 모두 명시해야 하며,
  Windows junction/reparse point와 archive 경로 탈출을 거부합니다. 공개
  portability CI는 Windows·macOS·Ubuntu에서 실제 0.18.0 archive를 검증합니다.
- runtime archive 검증도 CI extractor와 같이 대소문자 충돌 경로를 거부하고,
  새로 추가한 CI action은 변경 가능한 tag 대신 commit SHA로 고정했습니다.

## 1.17.1 - 미인증 브라우저 pre-submit 정산

- Oracle 전용 브라우저 프로필의 ChatGPT 로그인이 만료되면 컴포저 이전 단계에서
  종료되어 대화가 생성되지 않습니다. 그런데 이 조합이 `settle-no-submission`의
  인정 유형에 없어 제출 부재가 실증됐는데도 정산이 거부되고 프로젝트 락이
  영구히 유지됐습니다. `oracle-browser-session-absent-pre-submit/v1` 유형을
  추가했습니다.
- 판별은 좁게 유지합니다. stdout이 세션 미검출과 쿠키 미적용을 함께 기록하고,
  output이 없고, stdout과 모든 recovery 로그에 `chatgpt.com/c/` 대화 URL이 없고,
  mission 해시·경로·프로젝트 루트가 일치할 때만 인정합니다. 대화 URL이 있거나
  harvest가 실제 탭을 찾은 run은 그대로 거부됩니다.
- 정산이 `transport_status`와 `session_authority`를 다시 쓰기 때문에 기록 시점
  값만 인정하면 기록된 정산을 재검증할 수 없어 락이 풀리지 않았습니다. 정산 후
  상태도 함께 인정해 기록·재검증·소유자 판정 세 경로가 같은 결론을 냅니다.

## 1.17.0 - 재개 가능한 최초 설치 마법사와 커넥터 신원 가드

- `onboard.py`에 `start`, `next`, `resume`, `confirm`, `record-final-gate`를
  추가해 최초 설치를 중단·재개 가능한 상태 기계로 만들었습니다. 상태는
  `~/.codex/state/codex-web-gpt-automation/onboarding/state.json`에 저장되며
  암호·token·cookie·OAuth secret을 담지 않도록 저장 시점에 검사합니다.
- `next`는 완료 단계를 다시 실행하거나 다음 단계로 건너뛰지 않고 현재 단계
  하나만 반환합니다. 사용자 소유 단계의 `confirm`은 실제 증거로 재검증되며,
  증거가 없으면 `STAGE_CONFIRMATION_NOT_PROVEN_BY_EVIDENCE`로 거부합니다.
- 완료 표시를 프로그램 설치 완료, ChatGPT 연결 대기, 앱 등록 완료·검증 대기,
  전체 설치 및 실제 프로젝트 연결 검증 완료로 분리했습니다. `08_final_gate`는
  일반 비-Pro Oracle exact-root 읽기 증거를 함께 요구하고, exact allowed root가
  아닌 경로는 거부합니다.
- 앱 등록 단계에서 계정별 `플러그인`과 `앱` UI 경로를 모두 안내하고, 생성
  버튼이 없을 때의 확인 순서를 제공합니다. 요금제는 마지막 가설로만 다룹니다.
- 저장소 주소만 받은 에이전트를 위해 `docs/INSTALL_AGENT.md` 설치 계약을 추가하고
  `AGENTS.md`, README, 수명주기 설치 manifest에 연결했습니다.
- `start`, `next`, `resume`이 JSON 대신 읽기 쉬운 단계 요약을 출력합니다. 셸
  로케일에 따라 한국어와 영어를 자동 선택하고 `--lang`으로 고정할 수 있으며,
  기계 판독용 원본은 `--json`으로 얻습니다.
- 마법사 회귀 테스트가 늘어나 fast gate wall-clock 예산을 60초에서 100초로
  조정했습니다. 테스트 대상과 실패 판정 기준은 그대로입니다.
- 단계는 `06b_local_network_access`를 포함한 9개입니다.
- 진행 중인 유효한 상태에서 `start`를 다시 실행하면
  `ONBOARDING_ALREADY_STARTED`로 멈추고 `resume`을 안내합니다. 기존 진행 상태를 버릴
  때만 `start --reset`으로 새 상태를 기록합니다.
- `--lang`, `--json`은 모든 하위 명령 앞에서 받습니다. `next`와 `resume`은 명령 뒤에서도
  두 플래그를 받고, `confirm`은 명령 뒤에서 `--lang`만 받습니다.
- `confirm`은 앞선 단계가 미검증이면 `accepted: false`와
  `STAGE_OUT_OF_ORDER_EARLIER_STAGE_PENDING`, 막힌 단계 ID를 반환합니다.
- 여러 ChatGPT 플러그인이 `open_workspace`, `read` 같은 동일한 도구 이름을
  노출하면 `@앱이름` 멘션만으로는 커넥터가 고정되지 않았습니다. Oracle composer
  프롬프트에 `connector_identity_guard`를 추가해 등록된 앱의 도구만 사용하고,
  미션을 읽기 전에 어느 앱의 도구를 호출해 어떤 workspace id를 받았는지 한 줄로
  밝히도록 요구합니다.
- 첫 workspace 호출이 실패해도 자체 도구 배선을 조사하거나 웹을 검색하거나 다른
  커넥터로 대체하지 않고, 같은 루트를 한 번만 재시도한 뒤 구체적 blocker를 보고하고
  멈추도록 명시합니다.
- incident classifier에 `foreign-workspace-connector-substituted` 시그니처를
  추가했습니다. 플러그인 검색 흔적과 빈 결과 또는 workspace 미발급 흔적이 함께
  있을 때만 분류하며 기존 자기관찰·OAuth 503 시그니처가 우선합니다.
- `record-final-gate`는 `--root`, `--evidence`, 반복 가능한 `--listing`을 요구합니다.
  증거 요약이 너무 짧거나 목록이 없으면 `FINAL_GATE_EVIDENCE_INSUFFICIENT`로, 일반
  비-Pro Oracle 이외의 transport면
  `FINAL_GATE_TRANSPORT_MUST_BE_REGULAR_NON_PRO_ORACLE`로 거부합니다.
- 온보딩 상태 구조가 맞지 않으면 `ONBOARDING_STATE_CORRUPT`로 실패 폐쇄합니다.

## 1.16.1 - Strict Ultra 설치 문서 동기화

- `strict-ultra` 전역 skill이 참조하는 `docs/STRICT_ULTRA.md`를 수명주기
  설치 manifest에 포함하고 설치본 경로를 명확히 했습니다.

## 1.16.0 - Strict Ultra 감사와 안전한 DevSpace 파일 제거

- 기존 Oracle Multi v2 스케줄러를 그대로 사용하는 선택형
  `strict-ultra` comprehensive 프로필을 추가했습니다. dependency,
  authority, advisory Research Governor, identity ledger, local gate, 최종
  workflow audit가 닫힌 JSON keyset과 SHA-256으로 결속됩니다.
- strict Multi 결과가 실제 wave schedule, all-lanes barrier, audited apply,
  merger를 최상위 감사 자료로 노출합니다. 5개 lane/동시성 3은 안정적인
  3+2 wave로 기록됩니다.
- DevSpace 1.0.4 호환 패치에 일반 파일 전용 `delete_file`과 복구 가능한
  `trash_file`을 추가했습니다. 절대경로·경로이탈·reparse point·Git 및
  trash 내부 대상은 실패 폐쇄하며 trash 이동은 바이트 수와 SHA-256을
  재검증합니다.
- 신규 계약은 명시적으로 선택한 경우에만 적용되며 기존 standard,
  ultra-economy, ultra-gpt, legacy 경로는 그대로 유지됩니다.

## 1.15.12 - Luna Max CLI 및 Oracle 버전 해석 복구

- Local Multi-GPT 등록이 Codex Desktop 업데이트로 사라진 구버전 CLI를
  가리키면, exact server ownership을 확인한 뒤 최신 CLI로 원자 갱신합니다.
  setup과 runtime 모두 `gpt-5.6-luna` / `max` no-run 구성 canary를 통과해야
  하며, 지원하지 않는 CLI에서는 child나 job을 만들기 전에 실패 폐쇄합니다.
- pinned Oracle 0.17.1의 `npx --version`이 일시 실패해도 정확한 로컬 npx
  캐시 package version을 확인해 브라우저 생성 전 버전 해석을 복구합니다.
- exact `ORACLE_VERSION_FAILED` pre-submit 상태는 빈 stdout/output, 대화 URL
  부재, pinned command 및 lifecycle을 모두 검증한 경우에만 공식
  no-submission 정산 대상이 됩니다. 유사 오류와 모순 증거는 거부합니다.

## 1.15.11 - DevSpace restart pre-submit 공식 정산

- direct Oracle의 exact `DEVSPACE_SERVICE_RESTART_REQUIRED` 오류를 출력·대화
  URL·Oracle 실행이 모두 없는 bounded pre-submit host failure로 분류합니다.
- 기존 `settle-no-submission` 명령이 이 exact pre-submit 증거를 mission copy,
  stderr/transcript 및 locator 해시에 결속한 append-only receipt로 정산합니다.
  유사 오류, 출력 존재, URL 존재 또는 다른 lifecycle 상태는 계속 거부합니다.

## 1.15.10 - DevSpace 테스트 restart marker 격리

- DevSpace compatibility 테스트의 restart-marker state를 각 테스트의 격리된
  임시 디렉터리로 강제했습니다. synthetic package patch가
  `%USERPROFILE%\.codex\state\devspace-compat\1.0.4\restart-required.json`을
  남겨 이후 실제 Oracle run을 제출 전에 잘못 차단할 수 없습니다.

## 1.15.9 - Oracle 재귀 자기관찰 차단

- regular direct Oracle와 comprehensive stage prompt에 exact run ID/slug를
  결속한 no-self-observation/no-nested-Oracle guard를 추가했습니다. 웹 단계는
  자신의 Oracle state/output/transcript/recovery/observer를 읽거나 기다리지
  않고 요청된 미션을 직접 수행해야 합니다.
- terminal `BLOCKED`가 exact 자기 run ID와 slug, `running`, `pending`, output
  부재, `continue-observing-same-exact-session`을 모두 포함할 때만
  `post-submit-recursive-self-observation`으로 분류합니다. 일반 BLOCKED와 단순
  식별자 언급은 기존 분류를 유지합니다.
- comprehensive stage의 해당 결함은 자동 재시도 없이 terminal BLOCKED로
  종결하여 scope를 해제합니다. fresh run은 exact state/output/transcript 해시와
  명시적 사용자 권한을 append-only receipt로 결속한 뒤에만 허용됩니다.

## 1.15.8 - Ultra review FAIL 종결 수리

- hash-bound review receipt가 `FAIL`, `ready_for_next=false`, `next_stage=null`,
  비어 있지 않은 blocker와 유효한 critical finding 결속을 제공하면 workflow를
  `BLOCKED / REVIEW_FAILED`로 즉시 종결하고 comprehensive scope를 해제합니다.
- `PASS`와 `PASS_WITH_NOTES`만 계속 `web-multi`로 진행해야 합니다. 불완전하거나
  모순된 FAIL receipt는 계속 실패 폐쇄되며, 기존 Oracle run·output·receipt는
  수정하지 않습니다.
- terminal review 상태에는 receipt SHA-256과 critical finding 집합의 해시·개수만
  보존하여 다음 workflow가 이전 의미 내용을 상속하지 않고도 정산을 감사할 수
  있습니다.

## 1.15.7 - DevSpace read bridge 사전검증 수리

- DevSpace의 50KB 초과 단일행 `read_chunk` 사전검증이 전체 MCP 서버
  모듈 그래프 import에서 멈추던 문제를 수정했습니다. 설치된
  `server.js`에서 해시 게이트된 정확한 함수 본문만 분리해 최소 Node
  프로세스에서 검증하므로 Oracle 제출 전 버전 판정이 timeout으로
  오인 실패하지 않습니다.
- 정확히 결속된 `pre_submit` bridge-timeout run은 명시적
  `user-confirmed-pre-submit-workflow-cancel` 권한으로 workflow를
  `CANCELED`로 정산하고 scope를 해제할 수 있습니다. stdout/output/
  conversation 흔적이나 다른 오류는 계속 fail-closed이며 Oracle run state는
  변경하지 않습니다.
- 동일한 정산 계약은 패치 적용 후 서비스 재시작이 필요하다는
  정확한 `DEVSPACE_SERVICE_RESTART_REQUIRED` pre-submit 오류도 구분하여
  결속합니다. 서비스 재시작은 별도 managed setup 절차로 수행하며
  정산 명령은 서비스나 prompt를 조작하지 않습니다.

## 1.15.6 - comprehensive 사용자 중지 정산

- 사용자가 provider UI에서 응답을 명시적으로 중지하고 workflow 종료를
  요청한 경우, terminal-harvested Oracle run과 exact workflow/scope/run state의
  사전 SHA-256을 요구하는 공식 `--cancel-user-stopped` 경로를 추가했습니다.
- 정산은 Oracle run state를 수정하거나 새 prompt/recovery를 만들지 않습니다.
  user authority receipt, `CANCELED` workflow, released scope, completion receipt를
  원자 기록하며 중단 후 재실행은 동일 결속에서만 idempotent하게 마무리합니다.
- scope는 `canceled`를 terminal 상태로 인정해 새 workflow가 같은 exact scope를
  청구할 수 있지만, 기존 canceled workflow 자체는 다시 활성화하지 않습니다.

## 1.15.5 - 읽기 전용 웹 표면용 Ultra host bridge

- regular comprehensive planner/reviewer가 DevSpace의 변경 도구를 받지 못해도
  hash-bound stage envelope를 반환하면 host가 workflow 소유 output, next mission,
  receipt를 동일 계약으로 materialize합니다.
- Ultra GPT strict writer는 직접 쓰기 대신 parent/lane/source-mission에 결속된
  닫힌 writeset을 반환할 수 있습니다. host는 격리 worktree의 선언된
  `owned_paths`에만 원자 적용하고 file/byte/symlink/reparse/Git delta 경계를
  검증하며 직접 delta와 writeset 혼용을 거부합니다.
- DevSpace `read_chunk`를 추가해 50KB를 넘는 단일 UTF-8 행도 24KiB 이하의
  연속 byte chunk, 전체 파일 SHA-256, EOF 결속으로 shell 없이 완전 복원합니다.
- write/edit/bash의 MCP 안전 annotation은 완화하거나 읽기 전용으로 위장하지
  않습니다.

## 1.15.4 - Oracle 0.17.1 exact-session live recovery 보강

- Oracle 0.17.1의 복구된 Pro 대화 준비 대기를 고정 60초가 아니라 host가 전달한
  `ORACLE_LIVE_TERMINAL_TIMEOUT_MS` 전체 기한까지 유지합니다.
- 느린 대화 로딩이나 장기 tool-result 대기 중 같은 exact slug/profile/tab을 보존하고,
  readiness timeout 때문에 recovery browser를 반복 생성하지 않습니다.
- published Oracle 0.17.1 byte hash, patch 결과 hash, Node 구문을 회귀 테스트로
  fail-closed 검증합니다.

## 1.15.3 - Chrome Local Network Access 최초 설치 보강

- Windows 최초 설치에서 `chatgpt.com` 정확한 origin만 Chrome의 공식
  `LocalNetworkAccessAllowedForUrls` 사용자 정책에 추가하는 receipt-backed
  helper를 제공합니다. 기존 정책 항목은 덮어쓰지 않습니다. 정책 ACL이 쓰기를
  거부하면 traceback 대신 정확한 수동 seed-profile 1회 허용 절차로 전환합니다.
- 온보딩 상태는 영속 정책 또는 전용 Oracle seed profile의 실제 Local network
  허용을 확인하며, 로그인만 된 상태를 더 이상 준비 완료로 오판하지 않습니다.
  macOS 등 비-Windows 환경은 전용 seed profile에서 한 번 직접 허용한 뒤 Chrome을
  완전히 종료하도록 안내합니다.

## 1.15.2 - 터미널 복구 후 observer 자동 정리

- exact-slug recovery가 durable output과 terminal authority를 확정하면 원래
  runner가 자신이 시작한 Oracle 프로세스 트리만 즉시 종료해 프로젝트 submit
  mutex를 반환합니다. 새 prompt나 replacement run은 만들지 않습니다.
- recovery가 먼저 끝난 뒤 80분 caution audit가 도착하더라도 이미 확정된
  `complete / terminal / terminal_harvested` 상태를 `running`으로 되돌리지 않도록
  단조성 회귀 검사를 추가했습니다. 불완전하거나 모순된 상태에는 자동 정리가
  작동하지 않습니다.

## 1.15.1 - 모델 선택 전 미제출 정산 결속

- Oracle 0.17.1이 ChatGPT 홈에서 모델 선택 버튼을 찾지 못해 prompt 전송 전에
  종료된 qualified Pro run을 사용자 확인 정산 후보로 추가했습니다. 정확한
  selector 오류만으로는 해제하지 않으며 exact slug, 버전, copied profile,
  `execute-browser` stage, `promptSubmitted=false`, 홈 URL, output·대화 URL 부재,
  recovery-binding 불가 증거와 모든 관련 SHA-256이 함께 일치해야 합니다.
- prompt 제출, 대화 URL, output, 다른 오류·stage, 누락되거나 변경된 Oracle
  session ledger 중 하나라도 있으면 기존 잠금이 유지됩니다. 정산 receipt가
  만들어진 뒤 meta가 바뀌어도 재검증이 실패해 해당 run이 다시 unresolved로
  취급됩니다.

## 1.15.0 - 울트라 GPT 모드

- setup 문서와 실제 기본 runner app name의 불일치를 제거해 기본값을 수동
  등록 권장 이름인 `codex`로 통일했습니다. 명시적 host override와 기존 custom
  app name은 계속 지원합니다.
- Codex Ultra/Multi-agent의 bounded role 분해를 독립 Oracle 웹 GPT 세션으로
  치환하는 선택형 `ultra-gpt` comprehensive 프로필을 추가했습니다. 로컬
  Codex는 native semantic subagent를 만들지 않고 exact root, mission/receipt
  해시, session lifecycle, 결정론적 gate, Git/CI/Release만 관리합니다.
- regular web planner와 별도 reviewer가 계획을 확정하고, reviewer가 2~5개의
  병렬 `worktree-write` Web Multi 구현 lane으로 분할합니다. 동시 실행은 최대
  3개이며 각 lane은 같은 Git HEAD의 별도 사전 생성 worktree에서 실행됩니다.
  host는 project-relative `owned_paths`의 동일·상위·하위 겹침과 실제 범위 밖
  변경, Git metadata 변경을 거부합니다. 모든 lane이 통과한 뒤에만 canonical
  결과에 적용하고 merger와 별도 final verifier가 순차 검증합니다.
- Pro는 프로필 내부에서 선택할 수 없습니다. 사용자가 별도로 명시 승인하고
  설계 불확실성이 실제로 있을 때만 workflow 전 사전 자문 1회를 허용합니다.
  initial stage, stage budget, Web Multi 전환, lane access와 concurrency를 모두
  제출 전 실패 폐쇄합니다.

## 1.14.7 - Oracle stale observer exact recovery

- CDP가 끊긴 원래 Oracle observer가 프로젝트 submission mutex를 계속 보유해도
  동일 run/slug의 prompt 없는 `live`/`harvest` 복구는 exact-run 전용 mutex로
  직렬화됩니다. unresolved run 상태가 새 제출을 계속 차단하므로 중복 prompt를
  허용하지 않으면서 provider-terminal 응답을 안전하게 수확할 수 있습니다.
- exact recovery가 프로젝트 mutex를 다시 기다리지 않는 회귀 테스트와 동시
  recovery writer 직렬화 경계를 추가했습니다. 기존 terminal authority의 단조성,
  exact URL/slug 결속, output/transcript 원자 저장 규칙은 그대로 유지합니다.
  늦게 종료된 원래 observer도 이미 수확된 terminal state를 덮어쓰지 못합니다.

## 1.14.6 - DevSpace OAuth 장시간 세션 안정화

- DevSpace 1.0.4의 회전형 refresh token을 여러 도구 호출이 동시에 갱신할
  때 한 요청만 성공하고 나머지가 `OAuth token request failed 503`으로
  끊기는 경쟁을 보완했습니다. 이미 소비된 token을 영구 재허용하지 않고,
  동일 client·scope·resource 요청에만 30초 동안 같은 회전 결과를 최대 32개
  메모리에서 재생합니다. 만료·불일치·revoke는 계속 fail-closed입니다.
- 호환 패치는 upstream 버전과 pristine/patched SHA-256으로 고정되며, 실제
  DevSpace 모듈과 격리 SQLite DB를 사용하는 무네트워크 replay/revoke/expiry
  검사까지 통과해야 Oracle 실행 전 호환성 확인이 성공합니다.
- 장애 복구 뒤에는 config·OAuth DB·ChatGPT 앱 설정을 변경하지 않고 관리
  서비스만 한 번 재기동한 뒤 regular non-Pro canary로 exact root의 읽기와
  no-op 명령 반환을 검증합니다. Pro는 이 canary가 성공하기 전까지 막습니다.

## 1.14.5 - DevSpace exact-root 응답 경로 보강

- Oracle의 regular·Pro DevSpace composer가 미션 경로보다 먼저 exact project
  root를 명시해 checkout으로 열도록 변경했습니다. 미션 디렉터리, 상위·하위
  폴더, 현재 활성 workspace를 exact root 대신 선택하지 못하게 해 미션과 명령
  결과가 다른 workspace session으로 분리되는 재발을 줄입니다.
- DevSpace 장애 복구 뒤 첫 검증은 계속 quota 없는 regular Oracle canary로
  수행합니다. 로컬/public doctor만으로 registered ChatGPT app 응답 성공을
  주장하거나 Pro 제출을 연결 확인용으로 소비하지 않습니다.

## 1.14.4 - Oracle 미제출 정산 잠금 호환성

- 버전 파일만 갱신하고 GitHub Release를 빠뜨리는 일을 막기 위해 annotated
  `v*` 태그 push 시 버전·태그 형식을 검증하고 Release를 자동 발행합니다.
  유지보수 스킬은 exact CI, peeled remote tag, `releases/latest`, 설치 영수증과
  source/install parity를 모두 확인하기 전에는 발행 완료로 보고하지 않습니다.
- 사용자 확인으로 정산된 Pro attachment run은 정산 뒤 프로젝트의 비미션
  첨부파일이 정상 변경돼도 당시 state와 해시 영수증에 결속된 원본 identity를
  유지합니다. 미션·운송 사본·로그·복구 증거·출력·대화 URL·영수증이 달라지면
  기존처럼 fail-closed로 잠금을 유지합니다.
- pre-submit run의 exact Oracle session 부재는 복구 로그 바이트와 locator를
  재검증한 경우에만 진단·incident packet에서 명시적으로 분류합니다. 검증된
  미제출 run만 fresh run 안전 판정에 참여합니다.

## 1.14.3 - GitHub 요청과 복구 경계 정비

- 설치 오류 뒤 정상 rollback이 완료되면 WAL을 terminal 상태로 기록하고,
  이미 backup 바이트로 복원된 항목은 재실행 때 멱등적으로 인정합니다. 실제
  외부 수정이나 누락 파일은 계속 fail-closed로 차단합니다.
- exact Oracle recovery가 provider terminal 결과를 수확했는데 로컬 observer만
  `running`으로 남은 경우 동일 run의 terminal 증거로 정합화합니다. OAuth 503과
  stale observer는 doctor가 별도 원인으로 분류합니다.
- macOS Funnel LaunchAgent에 Homebrew 우선 PATH를 명시해 headless Tailscale
  CLI를 안정적으로 선택하고 App Store GUI 번들 경로를 서비스 탐색에서 배제합니다.
  이 수정은 PR #13의 핵심 제안을 현행 main에 맞춰 반영한 것입니다.
- GitHub 메인 화면의 깨진 release badge를 tag 기반 badge로 교체하고, 첫 설치·
  진단·기여 경로를 README 상단에서 바로 찾을 수 있게 재정렬했습니다. CI는
  수동 `workflow_dispatch` 실행도 지원합니다.

## 1.14.2 - DevSpace 상주 복구

- Windows DevSpace 부트스트랩을 로그인 시 한 번 실행하고 종료하는 방식에서
  5분 간격의 숨김 per-user 감시 방식으로 변경했습니다. DevSpace 프로세스가
  로그인 이후 종료돼도 현재 `~/.devspace/config.json`의 전체 root와 정확한
  Tailscale Funnel을 자동 복구합니다.
- `setup --apply`가 감시 명령을 등록하고 즉시 시작합니다. Owner 암호, OAuth
  클라이언트·refresh token, ChatGPT 설정은 변경하거나 기록하지 않습니다.
- 설치 manifest의 새 Pro transport 표기를 실제 정책과 같은 명시적
  `pro-devspace` 읽기·쓰기 계약으로 정정했습니다. 기존 read-only run의 복구
  의미는 그대로 유지합니다.

## 1.14.1 - Pro 첨부 무전송 정산

- Oracle 0.17.1이 프롬프트 전송 전에 정확한 첨부 업로드 타임아웃을
  보고한 경우에만 사용할 수 있는 fail-closed 사용자 확인 정산 경로를
  추가했습니다.
- 정산 영수증은 run/project, 원본·운송 mission 해시, 모든 첨부파일의
  경로·크기·SHA-256, Oracle 버전·exact locator, 업로드 타임아웃 marker,
  stdout/transcript, recovery 바이트와 출력·대화 URL 부재를 결속합니다.
- 사용자 확인 token 누락, 첨부 변경, 출력·URL·live recovery, 미지원 Oracle
  버전, locator 불일치 또는 다른 오류가 하나라도 있으면 잠금을 유지하고
  replacement 제출을 금지합니다.

## 1.14.0 - 명시적 Pro 읽기·쓰기 정책

- 일반 웹 작업은 `gpt-5.6`의 최고 지원 비-Pro 추론 강도 `extra-high`를
  기본으로 사용하며 Pro로 자동 승격하지 않습니다.
- Pro는 사용자의 명시 요청에만 선택됩니다. 표준 종합 워크플로는
  `allow_pro: true`가 없으면 plan의 Pro 전환을 제출 전에 차단합니다.
- 새 qualified Pro 실행은 `pro-devspace` transport를 사용하며 exact root
  안에서 미션이 허용한 파일 쓰기와 명령 실행을 지원합니다. 기존
  `pro-devspace-readonly` 실행 기록은 복구 호환용 의미를 그대로 보존합니다.
- README, 전역 정책, 라우팅·아키텍처·설치 문서와 Pro 관련 스킬을 같은
  explicit-only/read-write 계약으로 재정렬했습니다.

## 1.13.1 - Oracle 장기 실행 상태 점검 안전성

- 80분을 종료·실패·소유권 해제 시점이 아닌 caution/status-audit 임계값으로
  정정했습니다. 동일 프로세스의 생존과 출력 진행을 기록한 뒤 계속 기다립니다.
- 브라우저 관찰 프로세스가 응답 타임아웃으로 반환해도 동일 exact slug의 live
  회수를 자동으로 이어가며, 시간만으로 새 제출이나 replacement를 만들지 않습니다.
- 종합 모드와 legacy canary에도 같은 no-time-based-termination 계약을 적용했습니다.

## 1.13.0 - 첫 설치와 DevSpace 진단 완결

- 기존 DevSpace 설정의 root 병합, Windows 재부팅 root 영속성, Unicode root의
  PowerShell 5.1 안전 직렬화를 하나의 source-of-truth 계약으로 통합했습니다.
- 첫 `devspace init`을 현재 터미널에 표시하고, 생성 Owner 암호 유지 또는 강한
  custom 암호 선택을 TTY 전용·숨김 입력으로 안내합니다.
- Funnel public endpoint에 bounded propagation retry를 추가하고 마지막 redacted
  probe를 오류에 포함합니다.
- Tailscale status JSON은 Windows ANSI locale과 무관하게 UTF-8로 읽어 Unicode
  장치명이 있어도 setup doctor가 중단되지 않습니다.
- DevSpace 시작과 lifecycle doctor가 active Node에서 `better-sqlite3` 메모리 DB를
  실제로 열어 npm 12 install-script 차단을 사전에 발견합니다.
- onboarding plan/status/configure가 기본 `codex`뿐 아니라 검증된 임의 ChatGPT
  app name을 일관되게 지원합니다.
- 초절약모드는 새 Codex 작업의 최초 요청에서만 Luna/Max 선택을 한 번 안내하고,
  사용자 확인 뒤에는 런타임 모델을 읽거나 작업 중간에 다시 묻지 않습니다.

## 1.12.1 - Oracle 사전제출 CDP 복구

- Oracle 0.17.1의 정확한 CDP 연결 해제 오류와 외부 session ledger의
  `promptSubmitted=false`가 함께 증명될 때만 qualified Pro run을
  `pre_submit / not_executed`로 안전 정산합니다.
- 출력, 대화 URL, 제출 플래그, 모델·프로필·버전 또는 오류 형태가
  조금이라도 모순되면 기존 `submitted_unknown` 잠금을 유지합니다.
- exact-slug recovery가 이 증거를 감지하면 Oracle을 다시 호출하지 않고
  프로젝트 소유권을 해제하는 standalone Pro 회귀 테스트를 추가했습니다.
- 기존 DevSpace 설정은 백업 후 전체 `allowedRoots`를 원자적으로 병합하며,
  bootstrap JSON은 진단용 mirror로만 동기화합니다.
- Windows 로그인 복구 wrapper는 매 실행마다 live
  `%USERPROFILE%\.devspace\config.json`에서 root를 읽으므로, 재부팅 시 오래된
  bootstrap 배열이 새 프로젝트를 제거하지 않습니다.
- Unicode root가 있는 설정은 ASCII-safe JSON escape로 원자 저장해, BOM 없는
  UTF-8을 ANSI로 읽는 Windows PowerShell 5.1 기본 `Get-Content`에서도 손상
  없이 파싱됩니다.

## 1.12.0 - 브랜드와 릴리스 체계

- 포털·코드 괄호·연결 노드를 결합한 프로젝트 로고, README 배너, GitHub
  소셜 프리뷰와 사용 규칙을 추가했습니다.
- 한국어·영어 README를 동일한 정보 구조로 재작성하고 최초 설치, 모드 선택,
  안전 계약과 문서 지도를 한 화면에서 찾을 수 있게 정리했습니다.
- 현행 아키텍처, 문서 인덱스, 기여 가이드, 브랜드 가이드와 SemVer 정책을
  추가하고 legacy 문서를 현재 실행 경로와 명확히 분리했습니다.
- GitHub 이슈·기능 제안·Pull Request 템플릿과 저장소 주제/설명을 정비했습니다.
- `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, `install-manifest.json`, Git 태그와 GitHub
  Release가 하나의 버전을 가리키는 릴리스 계약을 도입했습니다.

## 1.11.3 - standalone Pro 전송 불확실성 정산

- Oracle 0.17.1의 정확한 prompt-not-observed 오류와 no-live-tab/no-URL
  harvest가 함께 있을 때 standalone qualified Pro도 사용자 확인 기반의
  `settle-no-submission` 정산을 사용할 수 있습니다.
- 출력, 대화 URL, 상충 recovery 상태, 다른 Oracle 버전, 다른 transport,
  변경된 미션 바이트가 있으면 프로젝트 잠금을 계속 유지합니다.

## 1.11.2 - stale Funnel 등록 후 복구

- `post-register`가 로컬 status상 동일한 매핑이라도 외부 relay에서 닫힌
  exclusive HTTPS 슬롯을 scoped `off` 후 동일 target으로 다시 수립합니다.
- 전체 `tailscale funnel reset`은 사용하지 않으며, 같은 포트에 다른 path
  handler가 있으면 이를 보존하고 비파괴 확인만 수행합니다.

## 1.11.1 - 드라이브 루트 위생 정책

- 전역 AGENTS 정책에서 테스트·임시·로그·다운로드·dependency checkout을
  `C:\` 또는 `D:\` 바로 아래에 만들지 못하게 했습니다.
- 기본 임시 위치는 OS temp의 task별 Codex 하위 폴더이며, 짧은 경로가 꼭
  필요하면 저장소의 gitignored `.codex-tmp`를 사용합니다. 외부 소스 checkout은
  `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Codex\Sources`에 둡니다.
- 기존 루트 정리는 소유권과 실행 참조를 먼저 확인하고, 확실한 자동화 산출물만
  복구 가능한 archive로 이동하도록 명시했습니다.

## 1.11.0 - 격리된 macOS Cloudflare DevSpace 터널

- Tailscale Funnel이 OpenAI 연결 제한을 넘는 환경을 위해 별도 Named Tunnel과
  전용 LaunchAgent를 추가했습니다. 기존 Cloudflare 터널과 `com.openclaw.*`
  서비스를 재사용하거나 수정하지 않습니다.
- 설치·재시작 실패 시 기존 관리 파일과 서비스를 복구하고, doctor는 macOS에서
  실제 loaded 상태까지 검사하며, exact managed artifact만 제거하는 uninstall을
  제공합니다.

## 1.10.0 - 초절약모드

- 로컬 지휘관과 모든 네이티브 서브에이전트를 `gpt-5.6-luna` / `max`로
  제한하고, Pro 설계와 regular 웹 검토·구현·최종 검증을 분리하는 선택형
  `ultra-economy` comprehensive 프로필을 추가했습니다.
- 최초 구현은 task-bound rollout runtime evidence로 Luna Max를 검증했으나,
  1.13.0부터는 화면·런타임 판독 오류를 피하기 위해 새 작업 최초 1회 사용자
  안내·확인 계약으로 대체했습니다. 전역 `config.toml`은 자동 변경하지 않습니다.
- Pro-first와 최소 4단계 계약은 코드와 회귀 테스트로 fail-closed 고정했습니다.

## 1.9.1 - ChatGPT 앱 등록 후 연결 안정화

- 수동 ChatGPT 앱 등록·재연결 직후 기존 DevSpace 설정, Owner 자격, OAuth DB,
  허용 루트와 Funnel 주소를 보존하면서 관리 서비스를 한 번 재순환하는 명시적
  `post-register` 단계를 추가했습니다.
- 실제 등록 앱 검증은 일반(non-Pro) Oracle `@codex` 읽기 검사로 분리했습니다.
  Codex Desktop의 동명 DevSpace 플러그인은 다른 연결이므로 등록 검증에 사용하지
  않고, Pro 세션을 최초 연결 검사로 소비하지 않습니다.
- public endpoint가 정상인 상태의 앱 호출 실패가 무조건 재등록을 요구하지 않고,
  한 번의 post-register 복구 후 외부 앱 경계를 보고하도록 진단 안내를 수정했습니다.

## 1.9.0 - 선택형 Local Multi-GPT

- 첫 대화형 설치에서 `Local Multi-GPT도 설치할까요? [y/N]`를 묻고 기본값은
  아니오로 둡니다. 무인 설치는 `-EnableLocalMultiGpt` 또는
  `--enable-local-multi-gpt`를 명시해야 합니다.
- 선택하면 스킬, 서버, `multi_gpt` MCP 등록을 한 구성요소로 설치하고 하위
  단계가 사용할 호환 Codex CLI 경로를 영수증에 기록합니다.
- Multi-GPT는 PATH의 오래된 CLI보다 등록 시 검증한 Codex CLI를 우선하며,
  Planner 실패 시 stderr 진단을 보존합니다.

README는 현재 제품의 목적과 사용법만 설명합니다. 구현 변경, 호환 패치,
레거시 이전 기록은 이 문서에서 관리합니다.

## 1.8.0 — Codex Web GPT Automation

- 공개 제품명과 저장소명을 Pro 전용으로 오해되지 않는
  `Codex Web GPT Automation` / `codex-web-gpt-automation`으로 변경했습니다.
  기존 `codexpro-*` 상태, 영수증, 스키마와 복구 파일은 하위 호환 ID로
  유지합니다.
- 설치부터 고정 HTTPS endpoint, DevSpace Owner 승인, 재부팅 복구, Oracle
  전용 브라우저 로그인, ChatGPT 앱 `codex` 등록까지 순서가 고정된 최초 설치
  가이드와 fail-closed onboarding 점검기를 추가했습니다.
- Tailscale Funnel을 자동화·재부팅 검증 경로로 유지하면서 Cloudflare named
  tunnel, ngrok 고정 도메인, custom HTTPS proxy의 안전한 합류 지점을
  문서화했습니다. 임시 URL은 완료 상태로 인정하지 않습니다.
- Oracle 0.17.1 manual-login profile 미초기화가 제출 전에 발생한 경우의 안전한
  잠금 정산과, `TASK_OUTCOME` 뒤의 제한된 Markdown reference footer 분류를
  회귀 테스트로 고정했습니다.

## 1.7.0 — macOS Ultrawork

- macOS arm64에서 공통 Python `install/update/doctor/rollback/uninstall` lifecycle과
  영수증/WAL/충돌 보존을 지원합니다. PowerShell 진입점은 Windows 호환 경로로
  유지합니다.
- OMO Codex Light, 로컬 CodexPro hook marketplace, GJC식 brownfield 인터뷰와
  합산 동시 실행 상한 5를 추가했습니다.
- `RUNNING → CHECKPOINT_DUE(75분) → HANDOFF_PENDING(80분)` 상태 머신과
  exact Oracle 회수, 동일 Codex session resume, launchd 감독기를 추가했습니다.
- DevSpace 1.0.4를 macOS에서 직접 실행하고 MagicDNS 자동 탐지 및 Tailscale
  Funnel `443 → 127.0.0.1:7676` 복구 경로를 추가했습니다. Funnel 엣지가
  OpenAI 연결 제한을 넘길 때 사용할 격리된 Cloudflare Named Tunnel
  LaunchAgent도 제공합니다.
- GitHub Actions는 `windows-latest`와 `macos-14`를 모두 검증합니다.

### Oracle + DevSpace 단일 실행 경로

- 일반 GPT, 계획, 검토, 수정, 지휘, 심층 리서치, 종합모드와 Web
  Multi-GPT를 Oracle + DevSpace로 통일했습니다.
- Pro는 기본적으로 Oracle + 읽기 전용 DevSpace를 사용하며, 명시적인
  `pro-attachment`만 고정 외부 증거에 사용합니다.
- CodexPro와 agbrowse 신규 제출 경로는 동결했습니다.

### Windows 브라우저 실행 격리

- 실행마다 로그인 프로필의 throwaway 복사본을 사용합니다.
- Windows에서는 Node 내장 복사로 프로필을 만들며 rsync를 요구하지 않습니다.
- 각 Oracle 실행이 소유한 숨김 Chrome만 정리합니다.

### 장기 작업과 복구

- 웹 작업은 기본 70분 이내 episode로 분할합니다.
- 75분에는 새 fan-out을 막고 80분에는 durable handoff와 정확한 owner 상태를
  평가합니다.
- CDP 호출이 멈춰도 host watchdog이 30초 grace 뒤 동일 세션을 보존한 채
  `attention_required`로 반환합니다.
- 제출 후 로컬 종료·브라우저 연결 끊김은 `attention_required`로 보존합니다.
- 복구는 저장된 정확한 slug와 대화 URL만 사용하고 새 질문을 보내지 않습니다.
- terminal 상태는 이후 관찰에서 live로 되돌아가지 않습니다.

### 종합모드

- plan → optional Pro/Web Multi → review → implementation → final web gate
  → local deterministic gate 순서를 사용합니다.
- 각 단계는 다음 미션과 workflow/stage/attempt/input-SHA 결합 영수증을
  직접 작성합니다.
- review 단계가 수정 가능한 계획 결함을 직접 고치고 구현 미션을 확정합니다.
- Pro 증거 파일은 `[PRO_ATTACHMENT_CONTRACT]`에 선언된 파일만 첨부합니다.
- 손상된 Pro JSON은 신원이 정확히 일치하는 제한된 경우에만 감사 기록과
  함께 복구합니다.

### Web Multi-GPT

- 독립 Oracle solver 2~25개를 최대 5개씩 wave로 실행합니다.
- Windows lane마다 별도 프로필을 사용합니다.
- 각 solver는 짧은 handoff 파일을 만들고 merger 하나가 안정된 순서로
  결과를 병합합니다.

### 설치와 릴리스

- 설치 전 파일을 백업하고 durable 영수증을 남깁니다.
- 기본 설치는 동결된 agbrowse/CodexPro 의존성을 설치하거나 갱신하지 않습니다.
- portability, fast gate, golden-path, v3/v4 계약 테스트를 Windows와 macOS
  CI에서 실행합니다.

## 레거시 기록

과거 CodexPro·agbrowse 기반 v1~v4 실행기와 goal supervisor는 새 작업을
만들 수 없습니다. 이미 저장된 실행을 원래 신원으로 복구할 때만 사용합니다.
자세한 목록은 [FROZEN_LEGACY.md](FROZEN_LEGACY.md)에 있습니다.

세부 커밋 단위 변경은 Git 로그와 GitHub Releases/Actions를 권위 기록으로
사용합니다.
