# MCP update guard

Use this skill for shared/global automation changes. Read the applicable
`AGENTS.md`, identify the authoritative source and installed deployment, and
preserve unrelated local customizations.

## Workflow

1. Classify the exact component and whether the work is an update,
   compatibility repair, policy refresh, or recovery fix.
2. Inspect source Git status and the installed file identity before editing.
   Never overwrite credentials, browser profiles, runtime state, or unrelated
   user changes.
3. For non-trivial GPT automation design or implementation, use the selected
   current GPT workflow only when the user asked for web delegation. Every new
   ChatGPT run uses Oracle:
   - regular modes, Deep Research, comprehensive stages, and Web Multi use
     Oracle plus the manually registered DevSpace app;
    - regular web work defaults to the highest supported non-Pro reasoning tier;
      only explicit user opt-in selects new qualified Pro with `GPT-5.6 Sol` at
      the Pro effort and read-only DevSpace for design, advice, or review. A
      regular `GPT-5.6` `extra-high` DevSpace stage performs file mutations and
      commands. Explicit `pro-attachment` remains a separate read-only
      immutable/external-evidence route and is never an automatic fallback;
      persisted legacy `pro-devspace` write runs retain their exact authority
      only during recovery;
   - CodexPro/agbrowse may be used only for exact recovery of an already
     persisted legacy run and never as a fallback.
4. Prefer small compatibility changes over wholesale replacement. Preserve
   local ports, names, roots, tokens, routing, and hooks unless the task
   explicitly changes them.
5. Batch coherent edits, inspect the final diff once, run focused regression
   tests, then broader tests according to blast radius.
6. Synchronize reusable GPT automation changes to the authoritative
   `codex-web-gpt-automation` source, install the verified bytes, commit with a
   descriptive message, push public-safe changes, and check CI.

## Upstream runtime freshness

Oracle and DevSpace follow the checked-in `upstream-runtime-policy.json`
`newest-validated-stable` contract. Do not keep an older runtime merely because
local patches were originally written for it.

- Treat each official npm `latest` change as an immediate candidate and let the
  read-only scheduled watcher report drift within six hours. The watcher may
  create or update one stable GitHub issue, but it never installs, promotes,
  patches, restarts a service, opens ChatGPT, or changes a project.
- Route that managed issue to the separately scheduled Codex maintainer. It
  owns the validation PR, required cross-platform CI, publication, lifecycle
  install, parity/doctor proof, and one safe-window managed DevSpace restart.
  A routine stable patch/minor has standing approval only after every gate;
  major/breaking, permission/OAuth, patch conflict, failed canary, or ambiguous
  evidence requires explicit user approval. Detection/validation/promotion
  targets are 6/24/48 hours and never weaken a gate.
- The drift issue is a task assignment, not the promotion actor. One
  scheduled Codex maintainer automation owns validation within 24 hours and targets
  promotion within 48 hours when every gate can pass. The owner plus required
  exact-commit CI performs the tests. Stable patch/minor promotion has standing
  approval only after all gates pass; breaking/major, permission/OAuth, patch
  conflict, failed canary, or ambiguous cases require explicit user approval.
- Promote promptly after verifying the published archive integrity and exact
  package tree, rebasing every required local patch with pristine/patched
  hashes, running syntax and focused compatibility checks, proving an Oracle
  no-submission canary and DevSpace health/root/large-read canaries, and passing
  Windows, macOS, and Linux CI on the release commit. A DevSpace canary must prove
  `open_workspace`, a separate mission-file `read` through the same returned
  workspace ID, and a `read_chunk` complete SHA-256 matching the local mission
  bytes; HTTP health, bundled instructions, or workspace-open success alone
  never proves the read route.
- Make the promoted version the explicit default for new work. Retain the prior
  verified version as rollback LKG and exact historical-recovery authority;
  never reinterpret persisted runs or execute a moving unpinned `latest` tag.
- Finalize source and installed bytes before the single required managed
  DevSpace restart. If a foreign live Oracle run could be disrupted, finish the
  GitHub/source gates first and wait for a safe installation window.

## Release completion gate

A version bump is only release metadata preparation. It is never evidence that
GitHub publication completed.

- Treat a change to `package.json`, either root version in
  `package-lock.json`, `install-manifest.json`, or the newest changelog heading
  as release-bearing work.
- Before reporting a release complete, require successful Windows and macOS CI
  for the exact release commit, then create and push the annotated
  `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` tag for that exact commit. The tag-push release workflow
  must finish successfully and create a non-draft GitHub Release.
- Verify all four identities independently: source metadata version, the
  peeled remote tag commit, GitHub Release tag, and GitHub `releases/latest`.
  They must
  name the same version and exact commit. Also verify the lifecycle install
  receipt and source/install byte parity for shipped files.
- If the tag, release workflow, GitHub Release, latest-release pointer, exact CI,
  receipt, or parity cannot be verified, report `release incomplete` with the
  missing gate. Never call a version bump, commit, push, or successful branch CI
  a published release.
- Never move or recreate a published tag. Repair release metadata in place when
  its tag is correct; otherwise publish a new patch version.

## Single repair owner

Automation sources have exactly one repair owner. A project session that hits an
automation defect reports it and stops; it does not edit runners, state, patches,
or their tests. Cross-session patching previously produced duplicate fixes,
conflicting state rules, and repairs aimed at the layer that reported the symptom
instead of the layer that failed.

- Build the handover with
  `python "$env:USERPROFILE\.codex\bin\chatgpt_oracle_incident.py" report --run-dir <exact-run-dir>`.
  The packet carries the exact run directory, the classified bucket, the
  lifecycle verdict with its authority source, and existing evidence paths.
  Its v2 routing block must name `evaluated_from_thread`, the exact
  `target_source_thread_id`, run ID, slug, and whether the instruction is
  executable by the evaluating task. Send each target task its own report;
  never broadcast one owner's operational instruction to sibling tasks.
- Re-read exact state immediately before an operational handoff. A terminal,
  harvested run receives `action=none`, including when its local status is
  `attention_required`. A foreign evaluator receives only
  `action=route-to-owner-task` and must not recover, harvest, settle, stop, or
  retry that run.
- Classify before repairing. Run
  `python "$env:USERPROFILE\.codex\bin\chatgpt_oracle_diagnose.py" --summary-only`
  and fix the largest bucket rather than the newest report. A `pre-submit-*`
  bucket proves no web submission occurred and is safe to retry; a
  `post-submit-*` bucket requires exact-slug recovery and never a replacement
  submission.
- Treat `safe_for_fresh_run: false` as binding. Do not resubmit, stop, or close
  another session's work while repairing code.

## Unknown-run quarantine escape hatch

Every task-bound Oracle lock has a last-resort administrative terminalization
path. Use it only after ordinary exact recovery and evidence-based settlement
cannot finish, the user explicitly authorizes the exact run, and every recorded
run-owned process is stopped. It preserves the provider outcome as `unknown`;
it does not reinterpret the run as submitted, unsubmitted, successful, or
failed.

Preview and then repeat without `--dry-run`:

```text
python <installed-or-source>/bin/chatgpt_oracle_run.py quarantine-unknown-run --run-dir <exact-active-run-dir> --expected-state-sha256 <sha256> --confirmation user-authorized-unknown-run-quarantine --reason "<exact user authority and incident>" --dry-run
```

The command is same-task only. It writes an append-only intent, atomically
moves the unchanged run under `quarantined-runs/<source-thread-id>/`, verifies
the archived tree, and writes a completion receipt under
`quarantine-lock-receipts/<source-thread-id>/`. Repeating the command resumes a
crash before or after the move. Never delete or edit the original state, adopt
a foreign task, or use quarantine while an exact run-owned process is live.

Quarantine releases the active local lock but deliberately installs a retry
barrier. A new prompt remains blocked until the same owning task receives a
second explicit user decision acknowledging that the provider outcome is still
unknown. Preview and then apply:

```text
python <installed-or-source>/bin/chatgpt_oracle_run.py authorize-retry-after-quarantine --completion-receipt <exact-completion-json> --expected-completion-sha256 <sha256> --confirmation user-authorized-retry-after-unknown-quarantine --reason "<explicit duplicate-risk decision>" --dry-run
```

This two-step contract guarantees that a local lock can be terminalized without
silently converting network uncertainty into a duplicate submission. A foreign
task still routes to the exact owner; legacy-unbound retirement remains a
separate bounded maintenance procedure.

## Safety boundaries

- Do not delete or recreate credential-bearing state during a normal update.
- Do not use resource pressure as authority to block, terminate, downgrade, or
  duplicate user-visible work.
- Do not silently switch Oracle model, reasoning level, transport, or browser
  backend.
- Do not create a new legacy agbrowse/CodexPro run while repairing recovery
  code.
- Stop and report exact dirty files when authoritative persistence, push, or CI
  cannot be completed.

## Report

Report updated components, preserved customizations, focused and broad
verification, installed/source synchronization, commit/push/CI state, rollback
evidence, and any remaining risk. For release-bearing work, separately report
the version, exact commit, remote annotated tag, GitHub Release URL,
`releases/latest` result, release-workflow run, install receipt, and parity.
For any run-specific next action, include `evaluated_from_thread`,
`target_source_thread_id`, exact run ID/slug, and current lifecycle. Omit the
action entirely from reports to non-target tasks; do not reuse identical
operational paragraphs across different task IDs.
